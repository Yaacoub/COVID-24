# COVID-24

## Game Rules

The rules of the game are simple. Infect and then kill as many people as possible in the shortest amount of time. To achieve this, the disease designer has access to a control panel that allows them to see the spread of their disease on a world map in near real-time.

In the conceptual phase, the designer can choose to start the disease spread in the desired region. Depending on the chosen region, the spread can be more or less rapid. For more difficulty, we recommend starting with Oceania, tough with its fighting kangaroos and hairy spiders. For simplicity, a zone in Asia can't hurt. It's like starting in Wuhan but better, you'll see.

The designer can also use their toolbox to improve the attributes of their disease:
- Lethality: the ability to kill the infected population.
- Infectivity: the ability to infect the healthy population.
- Camouflage: the ability to hide from cures.
- Reassembly: the ability to regroup against a cure.
- Heat resistance: the ability to spread in hot areas (≥ 20 ºC).
- Cold resistance: the ability to spread in cold areas (< 20 ºC).

Finally, the designer can access detailed population data in each zone of planet Earth. Thankfully, they can't infect other planets!

The end is never reached, and there will always be a certain number of genetically advantaged humans who will survive no matter what. The goal is not to eradicate everyone but to eradicate the weakest as quickly as possible.

Thus, strategy is key. Killing everyone too early would reduce the chances of the disease spreading. Killing too late would increase the chances of the disease being cured too soon.

Stay alert and don't forget your main goal: to annihilate humanity.
